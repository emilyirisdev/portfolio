# Portfolio Website

My Portfolio Website
For my first project I will create a portfolio website to house all my projects. I plan on using HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript at a minimum. The website is currently a basic concept, since I haven't decided on how I want to trick it out yet. I would like a Light/Dark toggle.

# Formatting 
The website will include the following format:

  1. Landing/Index Page
  2. Portfolio
  3. About
  4. Contact
